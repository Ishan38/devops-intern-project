InventoWare: Legacy Application Modernizaion with IaC

Project definition:
InventoWare is a DevOps-driven project designed to demonstrate the modernization of a legacy application using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud-native technologies. The project involves building a simple cloud-based “Hello World” application using Python, which is then containerized with Docker. It showcases how to automate infrastructure provisioning on AWS using Terraform, configure and manage application environments using Ansible, and implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. To ensure security, the project also integrates Trivy for scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities. This end-to-end solution illustrates how legacy applications can be transformed into scalable, secure, and easily deployable cloud-native systems using modern DevOps practices and tools.

Scope:

Develop a basic Python-based web application.
Containerize the application using Docker for portability and consistency.
Use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, security groups).
Automate server configuration and software installation using Ansible.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate code build, test, and deployment.
Integrate Trivy to scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities.
Demonstrate the complete DevOps lifecycle, from development to deployment.
Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure repeatable and scalable deployments.
Provide a foundational project suitable for learning, training, and demonstration purposes.
Exclude advanced production-grade features such as microservices, monitoring, load balancing, and autoscaling.

Objectives:

Modernize a legacy application by converting it into a lightweight, cloud-native solution using DevOps best practices.
Develop a simple Python-based "Hello World" application as the foundation for demonstrating infrastructure automation and CI/CD workflows.
Containerize the application using Docker to ensure portability, consistency, and ease of deployment across environments.
Provision AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform, applying Infrastructure as Code principles to achieve scalable and reproducible deployments.
Automate system configuration and environment setup with Ansible, reducing manual effort and ensuring environment consistency.
Create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process, increasing development efficiency and reliability.
Ensure application security by integrating Trivy for scanning Docker images and identifying vulnerabilities before deployment.

Data pipeline:

 Technologies Used : “We’ve selected a stack of proven tools: 
• Terraform provisions infrastructure in AWS. 
• Ansible automates system configuration. 
• Docker containers package our app. 
• Jenkins handles CI/CD automation. 
• SonarQube ensures code quality. 
• Trivy secures our Docker images. 
• AWS ECS and Kubernetes manage deployments. 
• Grafana, Prometheus, and Datadog handle monitoring
